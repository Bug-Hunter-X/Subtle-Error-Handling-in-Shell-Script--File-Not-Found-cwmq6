This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle error in shell scripting: inadequate error handling when dealing with file operations. The `bug.sh` script attempts to read a file, but if the file doesn't exist, it only prints an error message before continuing execution. This might lead to unexpected behavior or incorrect results in subsequent operations that rely on the file's contents. The `bugSolution.sh` provides an improved version that handles the error more robustly, using exit codes to prevent further operations if the file is not found.
